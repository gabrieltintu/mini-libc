# Mini-libc

## Objectives

- Learn about the structure and functionalities provided by the standard C library
- Accommodate with the syscall interface in Linux
- Gain a better understanding of strings and memory management functions
- Learn how the standard C library provides support for low-level input/output operations

## Statement

Build a **minimalistic** [**standard C library**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) implementation for Linux systems (named **mini-libc**), that can be used as a replacement for the **system libc** ([glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) in Linux).
The goal is to have a minimally functional libc with features such as string management, basic memory support and POSIX file I/O.

The implementation of mini-libc will be **freestanding**, i.e. it will not use any outside library calls.
It will be implemented on top of the system call interface provided by Linux on an `x86_64` architecture.

System call invocation is done via the `syscall()` function defined in `src/syscall.c`.
That itself makes a call to the architecture-specific call in `src/internal/arch/x86_64/syscall_arch.h`;
hence the dependency on the `x86_64` architecture.

### API and Implementation Tasks

The application programming interface (API) of the C standard library is declared in a number of header files.
Each header file contains one or more function declarations, data type definitions and macros.

- `<string.h>`: defines string-handling functions

  Implemented the following functions: `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, `strlen()`, `strncpy()`, `strncat()`, `strcmp()`, `strncmp()`, `strstr()`, `strrstr()`, `memcpy()`, `memset()`, `memmove()`, `memcmp()`.

- `<stdio.h>`: defines printing and I/O functions

  Implemented `puts()`.

- `<unistd.h>`, `<sys/fcntl.h>` and `<sys/stat.h>`: define I/O primitives

  Implemented the following functions: `open()`, `close()`, `lseek()`, `stat()`, `fstat()`, `truncate()`, `ftruncate()`.

  Implemented the `nanosleep()` and `sleep()` functions.

- `<stdlib.h`> and `<sys/mman.h>` define memory allocation functions

  Implemented the following functions: `malloc()`, `free()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, `realloc_array()`, `mmap()`, `mremap()`, `munmap()`.

  For managing memory areas, a basic list structure is provided in `include/internal/mm/mem_list.h` and `mm/mem_list.c`.

- `<errno.h>` and `errno.c`: declare and define the integer variable `errno`, which is set by system calls and some library functions in the event of an error to indicate what went wrong.

- the `time.h` header
- the declaration and the implementation of `puts()`
- the declaration and the implementation of `nanosleep()` and `sleep()`
- the update of the libc `Makefile` to build the source code files implementing `puts()`, `nanosleep()` and `sleep()`

  :exclamation::exclamation: **Pay attention** to which functions have to modify the `errno` variable.
